#summary An overview of the design off the Java Checkout API.

= Introduction =

This page describes the design decisions which were taken when designing the Java Checkout API classes.

= Design =

The Google Checkout API falls in to 4 categories.


*Checkout API*  This API allows the developer to post shopping carts to Google.  

*Merchant Calculations API*  This API is a callback from Google to the merchant in order to calculate complex tax and shipping rules in real time.

*Notifications API* This API is a callback from Google to the merchant in order to provide status updates for an order.

*Order Processing API*  This API allows the developer to send processing instructions pertinent to an order to Google.

These APIs are described in more detail here:  [http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html Google Checkout API]

== Outgoing APIs ==

The outgoing APIs are the *Checkout API* and the *Order Processing API*.  The diagram describes the structure of these interfaces.
